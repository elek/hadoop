      <title>What Is Apache Hadoop?</title>

      <p>
      
      The Apache&trade; Hadoop&reg; project develops open-source software for
      reliable, scalable, distributed computing.

      </p>
      
      <p>
      
      The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that
      allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters
      of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up
      from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local
      computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver
      high-avaiability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle
      failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-availabile
      service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to
      failures.
      
      </p>
      
      <p>
      The project includes these modules:
       </p>

       <ul>
       <li><strong>Hadoop Common</strong>: 
       The common utilities that support the other Hadoop modules. </li>

       <li><strong>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS&trade;)</strong>: 
       A distributed file system that provides high-throughput access to application data.</li>

       <li><strong>Hadoop YARN</strong>: 
       A framework for job scheduling and cluster resource management.</li>

       <li><strong>Hadoop MapReduce</strong>: 
       A YARN-based system for parallel processing of large data sets.</li>
       </ul>

      <p>Other Hadoop-related projects at Apache include:</p>
      <ul>

      <li><a href="ext:ambari"><strong>Ambari&trade;</strong></a>: 
      A web-based tool for provisioning, managing, and monitoring Apache Hadoop 
      clusters which includes support for Hadoop HDFS, Hadoop MapReduce, Hive, 
      HCatalog, HBase, ZooKeeper, Oozie, Pig and Sqoop. Ambari also provides
      a dashboard for viewing cluster health such as heatmaps and ability to
      view MapReduce, Pig and Hive applications visually alongwith features to 
      diagnose their performance characteristics in a user-friendly manner.</li> 

      <li><a href="ext:avro"><strong>Avro&trade;</strong></a>: 
      A data serialization system.</li>

      <li><a href="ext:cassandra"><strong>Cassandra&trade;</strong></a>: 
      A scalable multi-master database with no single points of failure.</li>

      <li><a href="ext:chukwa"><strong>Chukwa&trade;</strong></a>: 
      A data collection system for managing large distributed systems.  </li>

      <li><a href="ext:hbase"><strong>HBase&trade;</strong></a>: 
      A scalable, distributed database that supports structured data storage for large tables.  </li>

      <li><a href="ext:hive"><strong>Hive&trade;</strong></a>:  
      A data warehouse infrastructure that provides data summarization and ad hoc querying. </li>
      
      <li><a href="ext:mahout"><strong>Mahout&trade;</strong></a>:
      A Scalable machine learning and data mining library. </li>
      
      <li><a href="ext:pig"><strong>Pig&trade;</strong></a>: 
      A high-level data-flow language and execution framework for parallel computation.</li>
      
      <li><a href="ext:zookeeper"><strong>ZooKeeper&trade;</strong></a>: 
      A high-performance coordination service for distributed applications. </li>

      </ul>

     <title>July 2008 - Hadoop Wins Terabyte Sort Benchmark</title>
     <p>
     <a href="http://developer.yahoo.com/blogs/hadoop/2008/07/apache_hadoop_wins_terabyte_sort_benchmark.html">Hadoop Wins Terabyte Sort Benchmark</a>: 
     One of Yahoo's Hadoop clusters sorted 1 terabyte of data in 209 seconds, which beat the previous record of 297 seconds in the annual general purpose
     (Daytona) <a href="http://sortbenchmark.org/">terabyte sort benchmark</a>. This is the first time that either a Java or an open source program has won.
