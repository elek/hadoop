        <title>15 October, 2013: Release 2.2.0 available</title>
        <p>     Apache Hadoop 2.2.0 is the <strong>GA</strong> 
                release of Apache Hadoop 2.x.
        </p>

        <p>     Users are encouraged to immediately move to 2.2.0 since 
                this release is significantly more stable and is guaranteed to remain
                compatible in terms of both APIs and protocols.
        </p>

        <p>     To recap, this release has a number of significant 
                highlights compared to Hadoop 1.x:
        </p>

        <ul>
                <li>YARN - A general purpose resource management system for Hadoop to allow MapReduce and other other data processing frameworks and services</li>
                <li>High Availability for HDFS</li>
                <li>HDFS Federation</li>
                <li>HDFS Snapshots</li>
                <li>NFSv3 access to data in HDFS</li>
                <li>Support for running Hadoop on Microsoft Windows</li>
                <li>Binary Compatibility for MapReduce applications built on hadoop-1.x</li>
                <li>Substantial amount of integration testing with rest of projects in the ecosystem</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>     A couple of important points to note while upgrading to hadoop-2.2.0: 
        </p>

        <ul>
                <li>HDFS - The HDFS community decided to push the symlinks feature out to a future 2.3.0 release and is currently disabled.</li> 
                <li>YARN/MapReduce - Users need to change ShuffleHandler service name from mapreduce.shuffle to mapreduce_shuffle.</li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <title>14 February, 2013: Release 2.0.3-alpha available </title>
        <p>     This is the latest (alpha) version in the hadoop-2.x series.
        </p>
        <p>     This release delivers significant major features and stability
                over previous releases in hadoop-2.x series:
                <ul>
		            <li> QJM for HDFS HA for NameNode</li>
		            <li> Multi-resource scheduling (CPU and memory) for YARN</li>
		            <li> YARN ResourceManager Restart</li>
                <li> Significant stability at scale for YARN (over 30,000 nodes 
                     and 14 million applications so far, at time of release)
                </li>
                </ul>
                This release, like previous releases in hadoop-2.x series is 
                still considered <em>alpha</em> primarily since some of APIs
                aren't fully-baked and we expect some churn in future. 
                Furthermore, please note that there are some API changes from
                previous hadoop-2.0.2-alpha release and applications will need 
                to recompile against hadoop-2.0.3-alpha.

        <title>27 Feb, 2012: release 0.23.1 available </title>
        <p>     This is the second alpha version of the hadoop-0.23 major
                release after the first alpha 0.23.0. This release
                has significant improvements compared to 0.23.0 but should still
                be considered as alpha-quality and not for production use.
        </p>
        <p>     hadoop-0.23.1 contains several major advances from 0.23.0:
                <ul>
                  <li>Lots of bug fixes and improvements in both HDFS and MapReduce</li>
                  <li>Major performance work to make this release either match
                  or exceed performance of Hadoop-1 in most aspects of both
                  HDFS and MapReduce.</li>
                  <li>Several downstream projects like HBase, Pig, Oozie, Hive
                  etc. are better integrated with this release</li>
                </ul>

        <title>19 October, 2007: release 0.14.3 available </title>
	<p>This release fixes critical bugs in release 0.14.2.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title> 4 September, 2007: release 0.14.1 available </title>
	<p>New features in release 0.14 include:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Better checksums in HDFS.  Checksums are no longer
	  stored in parallel HDFS files, but are stored directly by
	  datanodes alongside blocks.  This is more efficient for the
	  namenode and also improves data integrity.</li>

	  <li>Pipes: A C++ API for MapReduce</li>

	  <li>Eclipse Plugin, including HDFS browsing, job
	  monitoring, etc.</li>

	  <li>File modification times in HDFS.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are many other improvements, bug fixes, optimizations
	and new features.  Performance and reliability are better than
	ever.</p>

	<note>When upgrading an existing HDFS filesystem to a 0.14.x
	release from a 0.13.x or earlier release, you should first
	start HDFS with 'bin/start-dfs.sh -upgrade'.  See the <a
	href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hadoop_0.14_Upgrade">Hadoop
	0.14 Upgrade</a> page for details.</note>
