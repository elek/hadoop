        <title>27 Feb, 2012: release 0.23.1 available </title>
        <p>     This is the second alpha version of the hadoop-0.23 major
                release after the first alpha 0.23.0. This release
                has significant improvements compared to 0.23.0 but should still
                be considered as alpha-quality and not for production use.
        </p>
        <p>     hadoop-0.23.1 contains several major advances from 0.23.0:
                <ul>
                  <li>Lots of bug fixes and improvements in both HDFS and MapReduce</li>
                  <li>Major performance work to make this release either match
                  or exceed performance of Hadoop-1 in most aspects of both
                  HDFS and MapReduce.</li>
                  <li>Several downstream projects like HBase, Pig, Oozie, Hive
                  etc. are better integrated with this release</li>
                </ul>

      <section>
        <title> 4 September, 2007: release 0.14.1 available </title>
	<p>New features in release 0.14 include:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Better checksums in HDFS.  Checksums are no longer
	  stored in parallel HDFS files, but are stored directly by
	  datanodes alongside blocks.  This is more efficient for the
	  namenode and also improves data integrity.</li>

	  <li>Pipes: A C++ API for MapReduce</li>

	  <li>Eclipse Plugin, including HDFS browsing, job
	  monitoring, etc.</li>

	  <li>File modification times in HDFS.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>There are many other improvements, bug fixes, optimizations
	and new features.  Performance and reliability are better than
	ever.</p>

	<note>When upgrading an existing HDFS filesystem to a 0.14.x
	release from a 0.13.x or earlier release, you should first
	start HDFS with 'bin/start-dfs.sh -upgrade'.  See the <a
	href="http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hadoop_0.14_Upgrade">Hadoop
