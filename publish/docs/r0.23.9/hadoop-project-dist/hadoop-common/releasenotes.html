     Major bug reported by Kihwal Lee and fixed by Jason Lowe (nodemanager)<br>
     <b>Log aggregation causes a lot of redundant setPermission calls</b><br>
     <blockquote>In one of our clusters, namenode RPC is spending 45% of its time on serving setPermission calls. Further investigation has revealed that most calls are redundantly made on /mapred/logs/&lt;user&gt;/logs. Also mkdirs calls are made before this.
