            <h1><a href="">Apache Hadoop Release Versioning</a></h1>
            <p><small>0001 Jan 1 </small></p>

            

<h2 id="background:354ef4b456b35fec8548cfbb5a5c00c7">Background</h2>

<p>Apache Hadoop uses a version format of
<strong>&lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;.&lt;maintenance&gt;</strong>, where each version
component is a numeric value. Versions can also have additional suffixes
like <em>&rdquo;-alpha2&rdquo;</em> or <em>&rdquo;-beta1&rdquo;</em>, which denote the API compatibility
guarantees and quality of the release. We use <em>&ldquo;a.b.c&rdquo;</em> and <em>&ldquo;x.y.z&rdquo;</em> to
denote a dotted version triplet.</p>

<p>Major versions are used to introduce substantial, potentially
incompatible, changes. Examples of this include the replacement of
MapReduce 1 with YARN and MapReduce 2 in Hadoop 2, and the required Java
runtime version from JDK7 to JDK8 in Hadoop 3.</p>

<p>Minor versions are used to introduce new compatible features within a
major release line.</p>

<p>Maintenance releases include bug fixes or low-risk supportability
changes.</p>

<p>Hadoop&rsquo;s versioning scheme has evolved over the years. The early days of
0.20.2 leading up to the 1.y releases saw a <a href="http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2012/01/an-update-on-apache-hadoop-1-0/">plethora of parallel
releases</a>
with different featuresets. Release activities coalesced in the early
2.y release era, with a mostly linear progression of releases from 2.0.0
through 2.7.0.</p>

<p>However, the ongoing maintenance of the 2.6.z and 2.7.z re-introduced
parallel active release lines to Hadoop. Additional plans for 2.8.z and
3.0.z releases mean potentially four active release lines, necessitating
clarification on Hadoop versioning and how it affects these parallel
release branches.</p>

<h2 id="versioning-rules:354ef4b456b35fec8548cfbb5a5c00c7">Versioning rules</h2>

<p>To establish a common foundation of knowledge, we require the following
in terms of release versions.</p>

<ul>
<li>For <strong>a.b.c</strong> (maintenance) releases, the &ldquo;c&rdquo;s need to be released
in order.</li>
<li>For <strong>a.b.0</strong> (minor) releases, the &ldquo;b&rdquo;s need to be released in
order.</li>
<li>For <strong>a.0.0</strong> (major) releases, it comes after a specific x.y.0
minor release.</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that new major releases need to be coordinated with the
previous minor release. New minor and maintenance releases only require
coordination within their release line.</p>

<p><em>&rdquo;-alphaX&rdquo;</em> and <em>&rdquo;-betaX&rdquo;</em> suffixed version can be treated as a.b.c
versions, with the first (e.g. <em>&rdquo;-alpha1&rdquo;</em>) being the a.b.0 release.</p>

<p>When it comes to setting fix versions, this policy is encoded by the
following set of rules:</p>

<ol>
<li>For each <strong>minor</strong> release line, set the <strong>lowest unreleased a.b.c
version, where c â‰¥ 0</strong>.</li>
<li>For each <strong>major</strong> release line, set the <strong>lowest unreleased a.b.0
version</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="example:354ef4b456b35fec8548cfbb5a5c00c7">Example</h2>

<p>As an example, as of August 3rd, 2016, the latest releases in the 2.6.x
and 2.7.x lines are 2.6.4 and 2.7.2. We have also cut the following
branches for planned future releases: branch-2.7.3, branch-2.8, and
branch-3.0.0-alpha1.</p>

<p>If we are committing a bugfix that is intended for the 2.6.5 release, we
would commit to:</p>

<ol>
<li>trunk (3.0.0-alpha2)</li>
<li>branch-3.0.0-alpha1 (3.0.0-alpha1)</li>
<li>branch-2 (2.9.0)</li>
<li>branch-2.8 (2.8.0)</li>
<li>branch-2.7 (2.7.4)</li>
<li>branch-2.7.3 (2.7.3)</li>
<li>branch-2.6 (2.6.5)</li>
</ol>

<p>Applying the above rules for setting fix versions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Rule 1: 2.6.z and 2.7.z are both minor release lines, so set
<strong>2.6.5</strong> and <strong>2.7.3</strong></li>
<li>Rule 2: 2.y.z and 3.y.z the major release lines, so set <strong>2.8.0</strong>
and <strong>3.0.0-alpha1</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Note that when backporting changes, we always make sure to backport to
the next higher release in a release line. For instance, we make sure to
backport to branch-2.7 (2.7.4) when backporting to branch-2.7.3 (2.7.3),
and to branch-2 (2.9.0) when backporting to branch-2.8 (2.8.0). This
preserves the monotonicity of releases.</p>

            <h1><a href="">Bylaws</a></h1>
            <p><small>0001 Jan 1 </small></p>

            

<p>This document defines the bylaws under which the Apache Hadoop project
operates. It defines the roles and responsibilities of the project, who
may vote, how voting works, how conflicts are resolved, etc.</p>

<p>Hadoop is a project of the <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/">Apache Software
Foundation</a>. The foundation holds the
trademark on the name &ldquo;Hadoop&rdquo; and copyright on Apache code including
the code in the Hadoop codebase. The <a href="http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html">foundation
FAQ</a> explains the operation
and background of the foundation.</p>

<p>Hadoop is typical of Apache projects in that it operates under a set of
principles, known collectively as the &ldquo;Apache Way&rdquo;. If you are new to
Apache development, please refer to the <a href="http://incubator.apache.org">Incubator
project</a> for more information on how Apache
projects operate.</p>

<h1 id="roles-and-responsibilities:11bd13a43f97d4350d33cbba9037763a">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>

<p>Apache projects define a set of roles with associated rights and
responsibilities. These roles govern what tasks an individual may
perform within the project. The roles are defined in the following
sections</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Users</strong></p>

<p>The most important participants in the project are people who use
our software. The majority of our developers start out as users and
guide their development efforts from the user&rsquo;s perspective.</p>

<p>Users contribute to the Apache projects by providing feedback to
developers in the form of bug reports and feature suggestions. As
well, users participate in the Apache community by helping other
users on mailing lists and user support forums.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Contributors</strong></p>

<p>All of the volunteers who are contributing time, code,
documentation, or resources to the Hadoop Project. A contributor
that makes sustained, welcome contributions to the project may be
invited to become a Committer, though the exact timing of such
invitations depends on many factors.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Committers</strong></p>

<p>The project&rsquo;s Committers are responsible for the project&rsquo;s technical
management. Committers have access to all subproject subversion
repositories. Committers may cast binding votes on any technical
discussion regarding any subproject.</p>

<p>Committer access is by invitation only and must be approved by
consensus approval of the active PMC members. A Committer is
considered emeritus by their own declaration or by not contributing
in any form to the project for over six months. An emeritus
committer may request reinstatement of commit access from the PMC.
Such reinstatement is subject to consensus approval of active PMC
members.</p>

<p>Significant, pervasive features are often developed in a speculative
branch of the repository. The PMC may grant commit rights on the
branch to its consistent contributors, while the initiative is
active. Branch committers are responsible for shepherding their
feature into an active release and do not cast binding votes or
vetoes in the project.</p>

<p>All Apache committers are required to have a signed Contributor
License Agreement (CLA) on file with the Apache Software Foundation.
There is a <a href="http://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html">Committer
FAQ</a> which provides more
details on the requirements for Committers</p>

<p>A committer who makes a sustained contribution to the project may be
invited to become a member of the PMC. The form of contribution is
not limited to code. It can also include code review, helping out
users on the mailing lists, documentation, testing, etc.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Release Manager</strong></p>

<p>A Release Manager (RM) is a committer who volunteers to produce a
Release Candidate according to
<a href="https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToRelease">HowToRelease</a>. The RM
shall publish a Release Plan on the <em>common-dev@</em> list stating the
branch from which they intend to make a Release Candidate, at least
one week before they do so. The RM is responsible for building
consensus around the content of the Release Candidate, in order to
achieve a successful Product Release vote.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Project Management Committee</strong></p>

<p>The Project Management Committee (PMC) for Apache Hadoop was created
by the Apache Board in January 2008 when Hadoop moved out of Lucene
and became a top level project at Apache. The PMC is responsible to
the board and the ASF for the management and oversight of the Apache
Hadoop codebase. The responsibilities of the PMC include</p>

<ul>
<li>Deciding what is distributed as products of the Apache Hadoop
project. In particular all releases must be approved by the PMC</li>
<li>Maintaining the project&rsquo;s shared resources, including the
codebase repository, mailing lists, websites.</li>
<li>Speaking on behalf of the project.</li>
<li>Resolving license disputes regarding products of the project</li>
<li>Nominating new PMC members and committers</li>
<li>Maintaining these bylaws and other guidelines of the project</li>
</ul>

<p>Membership of the PMC is by invitation only and must be approved by
a consensus approval of active PMC members. A PMC member is
considered &ldquo;emeritus&rdquo; by their own declaration or by not
contributing in any form to the project for over six months. An
emeritus member may request reinstatement to the PMC. Such
reinstatement is subject to consensus approval of the active PMC
members.</p>

<p>The chair of the PMC is appointed by the ASF board. The chair is an
office holder of the Apache Software Foundation (Vice President,
Apache Hadoop) and has primary responsibility to the board for the
management of the projects within the scope of the Hadoop PMC. The
chair reports to the board quarterly on developments within the
Hadoop project.</p>

<p>The chair of the PMC is rotated annually. When the chair is rotated
or if the current chair of the PMC resigns, the PMC votes to
recommend a new chair using Single Transferable Vote (STV) voting.
See <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/general/BoardVoting">http://wiki.apache.org/general/BoardVoting</a> for specifics. The
decision must be ratified by the Apache board.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="decision-making:11bd13a43f97d4350d33cbba9037763a">Decision Making</h1>

<p>Within the Hadoop project, different types of decisions require
different forms of approval. For example, the <a href="#Roles+and+Responsibilities">previous
section</a> describes several decisions which
require &ldquo;consensus approval&rdquo; approval. This section defines how voting
is performed, the types of approvals, and which types of decision
require which type of approval.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Voting</strong></p>

<p>Decisions regarding the project are made by votes on the primary
project development mailing list (general@hadoop.apache.org). Where
necessary, PMC voting may take place on the private Hadoop PMC
mailing list. Votes are clearly indicated by subject line starting
with [VOTE]. Votes may contain multiple items for approval and
these should be clearly separated. Voting is carried out by replying
to the vote mail. Voting may take four flavors</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>+1</strong> &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Agree,&rdquo; or &ldquo;the action should be performed.&rdquo; In
general, this vote also indicates a willingness on the behalf of
the voter in &ldquo;making it happen&rdquo;</li>
<li><strong>+0</strong> This vote indicates a willingness for the action under
consideration to go ahead. The voter, however will not be able
to help.</li>
<li><strong>-0</strong> This vote indicates that the voter does not, in general,
agree with the proposed action but is not concerned enough to
prevent the action going ahead.</li>
<li><strong>-1</strong> This is a negative vote. On issues where consensus is
required, this vote counts as a <strong>veto</strong>. All vetoes must
contain an explanation of why the veto is appropriate. Vetoes
with no explanation are void. It may also be appropriate for a
-1 vote to include an alternative course of action.</li>
</ul>

<p>All participants in the Hadoop project are encouraged to show their
agreement with or against a particular action by voting. For
technical decisions, only the votes of active committers are
binding. Non binding votes are still useful for those with binding
votes to understand the perception of an action in the wider Hadoop
community. For PMC decisions, only the votes of PMC members are
binding.</p>

<p>Voting can also be applied to changes made to the Hadoop codebase.
These typically take the form of a veto (-1) in reply to the commit
message sent when the commit is made.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Approvals</strong></p>

<p>These are the types of approvals that can be sought. Different
actions require different types of approvals</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Consensus Approval -</strong> Consensus approval requires 3 binding
+1 votes and no binding vetoes.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy Consensus -</strong> Lazy consensus requires no -1 votes
(&lsquo;silence gives assent&rsquo;).</li>
<li><strong>Lazy Majority -</strong> A lazy majority vote requires 3 binding +1
votes and more binding +1 votes than -1 votes.</li>
<li><strong>Lazy <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> Majority -</strong> Lazy <sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> majority votes requires at
least 3 votes and twice as many +1 votes as -1 votes.</li>
</ul></li>

<li><p><strong>Vetoes</strong></p>

<p>A valid, binding veto cannot be overruled. If a veto is cast, it
must be accompanied by a valid reason explaining the reasons for the
veto. The validity of a veto, if challenged, can be confirmed by
anyone who has a binding vote. This does not necessarily signify
agreement with the veto - merely that the veto is valid.</p>

<p>If you disagree with a valid veto, you must lobby the person casting
the veto to withdraw their veto. If a veto is not withdrawn, any
action that has been vetoed must be reversed in a timely manner.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Actions</strong></p>

<p>This section describes the various actions which are undertaken
within the project, the corresponding approval required for that
action and those who have binding votes over the action.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Code Change</strong></p>

<p>A change made to a codebase of the project and committed by a
committer. This includes source code, documentation, website
content, etc.</p>

<p>Consensus approval of active committers, but with a minimum of
one +1. The code can be committed after the first +1, unless the
code change represents a merge from a branch, in which case
three +1s are required.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Product Release</strong></p>

<p>When a release of one of the project&rsquo;s products is ready, a vote
is required to accept the release as an official release of the
project.</p>

<p>Lazy Majority of active PMC members</p></li>

            <h1><a href="">Criteria for Committership</a></h1>
            <p><small>0001 Jan 1 </small></p>

            

<p>Committers are responsible for reviewing and integrating code changes.
The PMC votes to make a contributor a committer based on an assessment
of their contributions to the project. Contributions can be made in many
ways, and there is no one route to committership. That said, here are
the general criteria that the PMC looks for from all potential
committers:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A history of sustained contribution to the project.</strong> This is a
way for a contributor to demonstrate their expertise in an area, and
thus their ability to help review and commit contributions by others
in that same area. Sustained contribution is also a way of
demonstrating commitment to the project, essentially that someone
will continue contributing even after they become a committer.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>High-quality contributions.</strong> As experienced contributors,
committers set an example for others in the project, and help
inculcate a culture of high-quality contributions. For code
contributions, this means clean, documented code which includes unit
tests if appropriate and passes precommit checks. For reviews, this
means thorough, actionable feedback, and a +1 vote (even
non-binding) only when there is a high degree of confidence in the
change.</p></li>

<li><p><strong>Community involvement.</strong> Contributors are always expected to be
polite, constructive, and respectful of others during community
interactions. Disagreement can (and will) happen over technical
issues, but the discussion should remain friendly and focused on
technical merits. Committers also have the additional responsibility
of mentoring newer contributors, as well as helping to grow the
community through actions like responding to emails on the user and
dev list.</p></li>
</ul>

<h1 id="example-paths-to-committership:2a051879bdcce6f947ad5b4ad6333da5">Example Paths to Committership</h1>

<p>Here are a few hypothetical example paths to a commit bit:</p>

<p><em>Han Meimei</em> works at a big company operating a large Apache Hadoop
cluster. While deploying the newest version of Hadoop to her staging
cluster, she discovers a number of bugs and performance regressions. She
files JIRAs for these issues, and is able to post patches for some of
them. On the remaining JIRAs, she works with other community members by
doing additional debugging on her cluster and testing and reviewing
intermediate patches. Additionally, Han Meimei works with the release
manager of the release line, <em>Lei Li</em>, to make sure critical issues are
backported to the next maintenance release. Han Meimei also makes an
effort to help fix and review other critical issues targeted at the next
maintenance release, even though her cluster is not currently affected.
She continues doing similar stabilization work for subsequent
maintenance releases in this release line, demonstrating her commitment
to shipping high-quality upstream releases.</p>

<p><em>Elise</em> works at a commercial big data vendor as a developer. Elise
ramps up by doing some newbie JIRAs, but then gets involved with a large
cross-company development effort happening on a feature branch. Elise
helps to review the design of the feature, providing constructive
feedback, and works with other community members to divide the work into
subtasks. At this point, the PMC grants Elise branch committership to
accelerate development. Elise submits good patches for a number of
subtasks, and shows care and thoroughness when reviewing and committing
code of others. After the feature branch is later merged to trunk, Elise
continues to find and fix bugs related to the feature, as well as
reviewing code contributions from others.</p>

<p><em>Raj</em> works as a test engineer at a commercial big data vendor. Raj
notices the lack of integration testing upstream, and contributes a test
harness for fault-injection testing which is committed to the project.
Raj coordinates with the PMC to get the test harness running on Apache
infrastructure, and starts triaging the output and filing JIRAs for
relevant bugs with reproductions. Raj helps with gathering logs and
reproducing issues, and continues making improvements to the test
harness.</p>

<p><em>Peter</em> is a technical writer interested in improving Hadoop&rsquo;s
documentation. He starts by fixing outdated information and incorrect
examples, reaching out to subject matter experts and exploring the
codebase to clarify technical details. As Peter becomes more familiar
with the set of documentation, he realizes that a newly contributed
feature didn&rsquo;t include sufficient documentation, and contributes a guide
on how to setup and use the feature that also explains some of the
design decisions that influenced API design. Peter continues to broaden
his doc contributions to more and more areas, and also is active
answering user questions on the mailing list. This demonstrates his
knowledge of the project, attention to detail, and also his user-focus.</p>

            <p><img src="/hadoop-logo.jpg" alt="hadoop-logo" /> Apache Hadoop</p>

<p>The Apacheâ„¢ HadoopÂ® project develops open-source software for reliable, scalable, distributed computing.</p>

<p>The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures.</p>
